# Our Security Management history Against Rainbow Tables Attacks

IAAC Recipe : Infrastructure as code is mandatory to evry single opertion on our infrastructure, So any change required by Our Security Policy, Will be waged with using a software, written with a programming language by our security  team ( So they are  `SecOps`, like there are `Devops` ) .
Our Security Team chose `Golang` language.

To tell you all the truth, the present README.md, was generated, commited and pushed by Our SecOps toolchain.
After our SecOps toolchain generated, commited and pushed this `README.md`, our SecOps guys added a few more commits, to include miscellaneous complementary information, like Comments in the table below.
But essentially, they  gety their hands on their Recipe's Git repos.

SecOps are monitored By  Chief Devops Officer (me) : Chief Devops Officer make them comply with rules, using good old CI/CD and user permissions classics.
