# Our Security Management history Against Rainbow Tables Attacks

IAAC Recipe : Infrastructure as code is mandatory to evry single opertion on our infrastructure, So any change required by Our Security Policy, Will be waged with using a software, written with a programming language by our security  team ( So they are  `SecOps`, like there are `Devops` ) .
Our Security Team chose `Golang` language.

To tell you all the truth, the present README.md, was generated, commited and pushed by Our SecOps toolchain.
After our SecOps toolchain generated, commited and pushed this `README.md`, our SecOps guys added a few more commits, to include miscellaneous complementary information, like Comments in the table below.
But essentially, they  gety their hands on their Recipe's Git repos.

SecOps are monitored By  Chief Devops Officer (me) : Chief Devops Officer (CDO) make them comply with rules, using good old CI/CD and user permissions classics. The rules he makes them comply with, are classic coding style, exapmple mandatory unit tests mapped to repo issues, plus architecture evolution monitoring involving CDO breaking down code and re-design deep architecture, propagated with SecOps framework updates.

Such a table acts, in our Information System, as a primary key to retrieve all management history, related to a wll identified Risk.

Many more information may be then attached to each primary key, such as those you may read in see this sample [Risk Management table](https://github.com/Jean-Baptiste-Lasselle/the-traefik-experiment/raw/master/counter-measure-1/Sample-ISMS-Risk-Register.xlsx) I downloaded it on October 30 2018) 

For that Sample Risk Management `xlsx` table (oh common, use Linux, please, as A CIO :o ... ), I must tell you that the Queenland's CIO did work on that xslx file, with a very clear goal : HE wants his service, Queenland's Information System, to be ISO 27000 - certified. That xlsx is what he will produce to certification auditors, among other things, so that they decide whether or not, they say OK, you are now officially certified, as a ISO-27 000 compliant Information System.
Or its Queenland's CIO giving every Queenland's entrepreneur help to encourage them toxards ISO - 27 000 certification.



# The final Countdown

Apart from a song I always found ridiculous, but in a sweet fashion, here is on image to make your Boss tell you "do it, NOW"  :

![Do it Now](https://github.com/Jean-Baptiste-Lasselle/the-traefik-experiment/raw/master/counter-measure-1/Clipboard%20-%20October%2030%2C%202018%204_55%20PM.png)

So yeah, It's just right here, Directly on Github, behind your door.
You just never knew.


# Other Risk Registries

(Because one organization alone, cannot be a self sufficent reference, whoever runs it. Or especially thinking about who runs it, and why)

* NIST (National Vulnerability Database) https://nvd.nist.gov/config/cce/index
* And many more, search them in each country, and choose a combiantion of countries that really can't get along with each other. Add 7 more countries, and you pretty sure you'll get something like what some people put in place in Europe (known as "European Union")  : Something really easy to manage.
