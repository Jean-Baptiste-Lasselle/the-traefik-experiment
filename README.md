# The Traefik Experiment
_Let's run withcraft_

In this repository, I will test various tutorials found on the web, most referenced by Traefik's officiel website.

Each Release of the present repository, will match a tutorial found on the web

In my work, you find zero docker image reference, either in `Dockerfile`, or in `./docker-compose.yml` files. 
It does matter : 
* If I was to use `latest` tags, or any tag letting environement resolve to different versions, on differents days (What if you read this tutorial on 13 May 2020 ? And what will be tests results, if you run everything in here, on 13 May 2020? ...)
* So I reference EVERY single artifact with **explicit** full version numbers, leaving no choice to dependency resolvers in the dependency manageemnt toolchain. And leaving you with no doubt on : 
  * what I did, 
  * why  I did it,
  * what were my tests results,
  * understand how I build proof-backed analysis for my customers, to give them control on their IT strategy, instead of letting them understand it's just too complex, they just have to trust me, and if something wrong, you just fire the IT guy and pay the hard price for the mess.

## Withcraft RELEASE `0.0.1`

So here I scan https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-traefik-as-a-reverse-proxy-for-docker-containers-on-ubuntu-16-04

Following this tutorial's instruction I :
* skipped the installing Traefik on bare Ubuntu, and chose to use Traefik's official image, in a simple docker-compose environment. I therefore started with setting up that environment, and then transposed every single [Digital Ocean's tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-traefik-as-a-reverse-proxy-for-docker-containers-on-ubuntu-16-04) steps to that docker-compose environment

#### Step 1 â€” Configuring and Running Traefik

* To begin with, Digital Ocean's instructs us to secure Traefik's first user ' access. Here's how they propose doing that : 
  * We choose a password, learn it by heart (Is there any difference to writing donw on a paper, or worst, in file... ? :o ). Then use a software to encrypt it. Accurately, this encryption is a one-way cypher, called a HASH. One VERY important thing here, is this : Whatever technical means Digital Ocean will propose, it will have ZERO VALUE in terms of security. Because what matters in security, is how you manage security, not what you did on one given aandom day. For exemple, things that are very important to understand there are :
  * What is hash / One way cyphering ?
  * What are the threats / attacks / vulnerabilites that are managed by this practice of using hashed password ?
  * And about Hashing passwords, I give the answer : A/ Hashing your passwords will protect you against the attacker that gets his hands on the database storing your customers usernames and password B/ It is very important, as of today, to use Hash algorihtm that use SALT, because SALTED HASHED passwords, will protect you against a very well known, and harmful attack, called `Rainbow tables`. Especially in those Kubernetes days, where many more people ahve a scale out platforma freely available.
  
  Managin threats, is what Greatest Generals do. Saying that you will destroy every existing threat around you  is singing ["M-i-c-k-e-y M-o-u-s-e"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmILOL55xP0) :
  Come to terms with it, there is no zero threats security zone anywhere in the world, even in your president's office, or in your King's Bed. Managing[ Threats is wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001), wise Genrals get Victory.
  
  

Okay, now with that we share a more consistent view, here is my councelor's report.

Your oprgansiation must have at least one person, responible of : 
* Every day try and find a match between [entries in a Security Risk Registry realated to Rainbow tables](), and a pair `{A, B}`, where :
  * `A` is a software or software dependency. Like a plugin a library, all kinds of vocabulary varying from one software to the other. Pretty much anything that has a source code. 
  * `B` is a version number of `A`, and `A` is deployed to production (inside your Information System) in version `B`.
Bear in mind here, that I do recommend that you Security guys do that work, not only things that are TODAY delivered to customers, or deployed to production, but to things that WILL be delivered toyour customers, or deployed to production. Make them do that work on software at the earliest stage: when developers start commit & push source code to Git. There are plenty of tools making that possible today. snew security risk related to Rainbow Tables thrreatening the company Information System: Security Risk identification. Security Team members will use every single methodology they have learned atschool and at work, same with tools, to do dig up security risks everyday. 
* Every week review the table, and assess Risk Management **improvement**, regarding Rainbow tables Security Risk. Again, what is important is not Assessing Risk Management current level, what is important is assessing Risk Management improvement, just like a physics sholar will explain you, that at any given instant, it does not matter what is your speed value is, what does matter is its derivative, acceleration. In IT, what matter far above **anything**, is time. Nothing else, but time. And accelration makes you earn time over your conccurrent. Time, rmeber that.
* Eventually, you will demand Security team to comply with an ISO 27 000 kind of review cycle on every identified risk, using [Security Risks Regisries], and devops-like systematic practices ([SecOPs](ccc) )
